"""ReportPortal logging API for test libraries with support for attachments.

Usage of this logger is similar to the standard robot.api.logger with addition
of an extra kwarg "attachment" to all logging functions.

Example
-------
import subprocess
from robotframework_reportportal import logger

class MyLibrary(object):

    def log_free_memory(self):
        logger.debug("Collecting free memory statistics!")
        logger.debug(
            "Memory consumption report",
            attachment={
                "name": "free_memory.txt",
                "data": subprocess.check_output("free -h".split()),
                "mime": "text/plain",
            },
        )
"""

def write(msg, level='INFO', html=False, attachment=None, launch_log=False):
    """Write the message to the log file using the given level.

    Valid log levels are ``TRACE``, ``DEBUG``, ``INFO`` (default since RF
    2.9.1), ``WARN``, and ``ERROR`` (new in RF 2.9). Additionally it is
    possible to use ``HTML`` pseudo log level that logs the message as HTML
    using the ``INFO`` level.

    Attachment should contain a dict with "name", "data" and "mime" values
    defined. See module example.

    Instead of using this method, it is generally better to use the level
    specific methods such as ``info`` and ``debug`` that have separate

    :param msg: argument to control the message format.
    :param level: log level
    :param html: format or not format the message as html.
    :param attachment: a binary content to attach to the log entry
    :param launch_log: put the log entry on Launch level
